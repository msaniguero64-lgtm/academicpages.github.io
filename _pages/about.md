I am a PhD candidate in Architectural Engineering at [Your Turkish University], specializing in human-centric building performance simulation and optimization. My thesis develops RFH-MDO, the first closed-loop framework integrating transfer-learning surrogates, parametric modeling (Grasshopper/Radiance/EnergyPlus), and VR-based occupant feedback for real-time optimization of energy, daylighting, and perceived comfort.

Key gaps addressed (from SLR of 62 frameworks, 2015–2025):  
- Prohibitive latency (< 500 ms via surrogates, R² > 0.996)  
- Missing human perception (live VR loop + dynamic AHP weighting)  
- Poor scalability (70–85% data reduction across typologies/climates)  

Validated on classrooms/offices in Mediterranean and Sahelian contexts. Open-source toolkit 2026.

Actively seeking postdocs in Canada (Banting/NSERC), France (CNRS), Belgium (FWO), UK, USA – focusing on AI/sustainable AEC.
